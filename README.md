## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Fetch API

### What I learned

In this challenge I was able to use the Fetch API with the provided data.json file to populate data based on the selected time period. This provided good practice for how to handle APIs in React and how to implement the useEffect hook to handle the Fetch API.

### Continued development

This was my first time using the Fetch API and going forward I would like to learn more about the different ways of handling API such as using the Axios library and implementing Async Await to the code as an alternative to the `.then()` syntax
